# CyberArk Hardening Health Check
One of the most important recommendations are to harden CyberArk servers.
We provide automatic hardening to our Vault and component servers (CPM, PVWA and PSM) through automated scripts and procedures.
Hardening is not an easy task and it covers a great deal of configurations and settings that one needs to apply in order to be compliant to our hardening best practice. 

>How can you verify that you actually did all the required steps? 
>How can an organization verify if they are compliant if they applied their own hardening best practices?

Wouldn't it be nice if we could ask the server - are you hardened?

Well, the answer is here - CyberArk Hardening Health Check.
